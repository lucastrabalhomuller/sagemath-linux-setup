# SageMath Scientific Environment (Linux + VS Code)

This repository documents a **fully reproducible setup of SageMath on Linux**
using **Miniforge (Conda)** and **Visual Studio Code** as a desktop interface,
without relying on a web browser.

The goal of this project is to provide a **clean, portable, and academic-grade**
environment suitable for scientific computing, symbolic mathematics, and
research workflows (e.g. Relativity, Differential Geometry, Mathematical Physics).
